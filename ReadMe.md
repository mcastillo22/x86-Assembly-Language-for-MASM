Reads user input of 10 numbers the hard way instead of relying on Irvine's ReadInt. 

After users enters 10 numbers, program will validate that the entry is a number, and will fit in a 32-bit register. It then repeats the numbers	back, and displays the sum and floored average.

Program uses macros to display and read all user input.
